# Proposal for Travel Journey App

## Overview
The Ventur app aims to provide users with a platform to document their past trips, share experiences, and read reviews from fellow travelers. The app will allow users to create accounts, add details of their previous trips including pictures and reviews, and browse through reviews left by other users.

As a user, I want to be able to browse through reviews left by other users so that I can read about their travel experiences and get recommendations for future trips.

#### Stretch Goals

As a user, I want to be able to save trips i'm interested in for later viewing.
As a user, I want to be able to be able to customize my profile.
As a user, I want to be able to search for trips based on destination, date, or keywords so that I can easily find relevant reviews and information.
